      <h4> Project 1</h4>
      <br>
      <h2> Introduction</h2>
      <p2>
For our negotiated project Nathan and I designed and programmed robots which would battle each other. For this project I was interested in designing a robot with more complex parts and an offensive and defensive feature for battling Nathan’s robot. The last time I used this technology was back in grade 7 where I made a robot using the same software but they were only carrying out simple tasks such as following a black line. 
      </p2>
      <h2>Objectives </h2>
      <p2>•	Program a robot that can turn when it reaches the edge of the fighting area.
•	Design a robot which has an “attack feature” to either disable or push Nathan’s robot out of the arena. 
•	Better understand the Lego Mindstorms EV3 programming.
	</p2>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p2>
•	I created a robot which was high up off the ground with two flipper arms.  
•	I successfully programmed and designed a robot that can move around in a specific area, turning around when the robot reached the edge of the arena.
•	I successfully furthered my knowledge of EV3 programming and designing.
•	In the test fights Nathan’s robots beat mine by pushing it out of the circle.

<h2> Process and Planning </h2>
<p2>To begin my project I looked around the robotics room for inspiration until I found a design I liked. I used this design as a template of sorts when I was building my robot. I then went about designing my robot and adding a colour sensor. This part took the majority of my time because I was constantly trying new ideas. After I had a rough design for my robot I went about trying to program it. I watched a short tutorial on basic EV3 programming to refresh my memory on how to program my robot before starting. After I remembered the basics it was a matter of moving my colour sensor around and changing the programming for it. Once I had a rough design and some basic programming all I had to do was test my robot and make some minor adjustments to the programming and design before my robot was ready to battle. Nathan’s robot and mine then battled in some practice rounds with Nathan’s robot winning the majority of times. I then changed the power for my wheels so my robot was faster. Sadly this made my colour sensor fail because my robot was going too fast for the robot to recognise the black line, so I went back to my original programming.  Our ‘real’ battle will take place when we present our robot. 
</p2>
      <h2>Discussion </h2>
      <p2>
Some problems I encountered were finding a lot of the smaller pieces to design my robot. I also had trouble attaching my colour sensor and ended up jamming it between the motors for the wheels. I also originally had trouble with the programming because I hadn’t used this technology since grade 7. Ways that I could make my robot better include attaching my colour sensor properly, having a ‘hitter’ arm instead of a ‘flipper’ ramp because that seemed to work better and I could also have made my robot more visually appealing. I believe that I had successfully met my goals for this project because I successfully completed all of my objectives stated above. In saying this there is also a lot of things that can be improved on.
